# FriendFinder
Complete a brief survey to find a friend or whatever.

The submit button gets all form data and logs a 'newFriend' object array to console.

I had some issues posting the object to friends.js, which left not much time to write the absolute value compatability algorithm.

With some guidance from the guys, I feel this app should be working by EOD 4/20!
