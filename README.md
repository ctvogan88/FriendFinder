The submit button gets all form data and logs a 'newFriend' object array to console, but that's about it.

The modal code is in the survey.html file, however I'm somewhat lost on how to actuate it after troubleshooting yesterday.

I had some issues posting the object to friends.js, which consumed the time I needed to write the absolute value compatability algorithm.

With some guidance from the CBC experts, I feel this app should be working by EOD 4/20!
